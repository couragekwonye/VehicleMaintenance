# VehicleMaintenance

 I wanted to bring to your attention a technical issue I encountered while sharing my data analysis project on GitHub. 
 Unfortunately, I have come across a limitation where the interactive charts coded with Plotly Express do not render properly when viewed directly on GitHub.
To address this issue, I have taken the liberty of providing an alternative solution. I have uploaded my project to my DataCamp workspace, where the interactive charts can be viewed and explored seamlessly. 
You can access the project by following this link:
